============= Cluster 2: =============interesting , but not compelling .
clever but not especially compelling .
============= Cluster 3: =============a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .
the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .
an extremely unpleasant film .
a high-minded snoozer .
labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .

a generic international version of a typical american horror film .
lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack .
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
an ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .

the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .

the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
a fascinating but choppy documentary .
plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
a film that suffers because of its many excesses .
a dreary movie .
boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .

the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it Â– as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
. . . a bland , pretentious mess .
this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers .
egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
[stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .
while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .
the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys .
a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .

the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .

a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .
at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
a coarse and stupid gross-out .
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .

the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .

the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
a bit of an unwieldy mess .
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .
a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
feeble comedy .

[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .
a less-than-thrilling thriller .
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .

as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .

the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
an awkward and indigestible movie .
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition Â– wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text Â– when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .

herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .
creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .

sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .

although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless Â‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .

a negligible british comedy .
a pretentious mess .
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
contrived pastiche of caper clichÃ©s .
despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .

an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
a half-assed film .

the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .
a preposterous , prurient whodunit .
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clichÃ© .
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
an uninspired preachy and clichÃ©d war film .
slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .

brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .

writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .
nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .

tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .
a lame comedy .
deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
a dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
a reality-snubbing hodgepodge .
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichÃ©s , depression and bad alternative music .
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .

an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .

the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .

[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .

'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '

============= Cluster 31: =============a relative letdown .
a well-crafted letdown .
============= Cluster 32: =============no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .

an extraordinary dramatic experience .
an enjoyable experience .
============= Cluster 34: =============stale , futile scenario .
a long-winded , predictable scenario .
============= Cluster 35: =============a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
============= Cluster 36: =============moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness .
============= Cluster 37: =============it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .
how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .
the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) .
============= Cluster 38: =============nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .
============= Cluster 39: =============an awful snooze .
a real snooze .
============= Cluster 40: =============director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist .
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence .
============= Cluster 41: =============a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .
============= Cluster 42: =============technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .
============= Cluster 43: =============when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble .
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
============= Cluster 44: =============the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other .
============= Cluster 45: =============ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
============= Cluster 46: =============passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .
visually striking and viscerally repellent .
============= Cluster 47: =============the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naÃ¯vetÃ© and arbitrary flashbacks .
despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience .
============= Cluster 48: =============what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy .
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
============= Cluster 49: =============" an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . "
" it's all about the image . "
============= Cluster 50: =============it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies .
============= Cluster 51: =============ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
============= Cluster 52: =============the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .
visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
============= Cluster 53: =============lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .
mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh .
============= Cluster 54: =============the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield .

============= Cluster 57: =============handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .
a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist .
============= Cluster 58: =============very stupid and annoying .
idiotic and ugly .
============= Cluster 59: =============`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .
the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties .
============= Cluster 60: =============the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it .
the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .
============= Cluster 61: =============the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste .
============= Cluster 62: =============the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .

============= Cluster 66: =============mildly amusing .

well-made but mush-hearted .

============= Cluster 69: =============a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .

============= Cluster 70: =============the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul .

the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .
