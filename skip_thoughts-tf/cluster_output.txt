============= Cluster 2: =============
0. a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
1. an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
2. a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
3. directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
4. rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
5. a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .
6. as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
7. an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
8. [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
9. a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .
10. its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
11. with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
12. some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
13. this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
14. directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .
15. the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .
16. the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
17. the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .
18. an extremely unpleasant film .
19. a high-minded snoozer .
20. labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
21. the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
22. a film that loses sight of its own story .
23. few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance .
24. the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
25. a generic international version of a typical american horror film .
26. lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
27. shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
28. although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
29. [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
30. there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
31. in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
32. a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
33. the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack .
34. a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
35. an ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
36. what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
37. as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .
38. it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
39. a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
40. ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism .
41. the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
42. the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
43. a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
44. jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
45. the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
46. each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
47. the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .
48. the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
49. the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
50. it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
51. the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
52. the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
53. chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
54. . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
55. schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression .
56. the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
57. the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
58. a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
59. a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .
60. will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
61. the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
62. an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
63. the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
64. a fascinating but choppy documentary .
65. plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
66. the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
67. the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
68. a film that suffers because of its many excesses .
69. a dreary movie .
70. boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .
71. a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
72. the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
73. the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
74. the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
75. there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
76. it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
77. brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
78. its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
79. the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
80. it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
81. . . . a bland , pretentious mess .
82. this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
83. super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers .
84. egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
85. [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
86. when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
87. kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .
88. director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .
89. while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
90. a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
91. the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
92. the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .
93. the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys .
94. a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
95. at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
96. the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
97. a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
98. overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
99. despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
100. this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
101. the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
102. while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
103. while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
104. a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
105. simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
106. the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
107. pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .
108. at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
109. a coarse and stupid gross-out .
110. a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
111. the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
112. but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .
113. star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .
114. its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
115. characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs .
116. in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
117. it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
118. while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
119. an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
120. a sometimes tedious film .
121. for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
122. the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
123. the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .
124. though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
125. on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
126. historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
127. perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
128. this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
129. even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
130. the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
131. marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
132. the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
133. the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
134. obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
135. a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
136. the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
137. a bit of an unwieldy mess .
138. the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
139. there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
140. much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
141. each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
142. as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
143. the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
144. the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
145. kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .
146. a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
147. being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
148. offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
149. feeble comedy .
150. with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
151. a dreadful live-action movie .
152. spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
153. [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
154. it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
155. the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
156. there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .
157. a less-than-thrilling thriller .
158. everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
159. with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
160. as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
161. though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
162. it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
163. what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form .
164. the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
165. newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
166. an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma .
167. the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
168. an awkward and indigestible movie .
169. the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
170. the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
171. sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
172. a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
173. it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
174. a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
175. stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
176. the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
177. the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
178. as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
179. preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
180. as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
181. the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .
182. a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
183. a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller .
184. based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
185. this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .
186. overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim .
187. herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .
188. creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
189. as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
190. bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
191. reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
192. despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
193. all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
194. an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
195. strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery .
196. the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
197. an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
198. succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .
199. christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic .
200. while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
201. gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .
202. the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
203. the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected .
204. a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
205. the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
206. the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
207. the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
208. it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious .
209. sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
210. a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
211. roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
212. twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .
213. while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
214. the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
215. the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
216. here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
217. it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .
218. a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
219. to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
220. although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
221. a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .
222. this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
223. though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
224. a negligible british comedy .
225. a pretentious mess .
226. because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
227. contrived pastiche of caper clichés .
228. despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
229. there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
230. the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design .
231. a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .
232. a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
233. the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
234. lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
235. not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest .
236. its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
237. an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
238. a half-assed film .
239. while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
240. interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .
241. cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
242. it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
243. even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .
244. though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
245. the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
246. the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .
247. at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
248. the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
249. there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .
250. a preposterous , prurient whodunit .
251. the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
252. an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
253. it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
254. the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
255. the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
256. much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
257. the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
258. opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
259. the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
260. unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
261. an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .
262. slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
263. the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
264. the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
265. nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
266. there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
267. like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
268. brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
269. a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
270. viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .
271. writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
272. unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
273. the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
274. a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
275. it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .
276. nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
277. aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
278. with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
279. an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
280. the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
281. a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
282. swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
283. almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences .
284. tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
285. a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
286. whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
287. high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .
288. the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .
289. a lame comedy .
290. deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
291. a dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
292. an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
293. high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
294. screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
295. a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
296. full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
297. a reality-snubbing hodgepodge .
298. the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
299. although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
300. after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
301. a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
302. coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .
303. mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
304. a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
305. an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
306. the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
307. each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
308. holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
309. an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
310. the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
311. what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
312. while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation .
313. a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
314. dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
315. time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
316. as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
317. the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
318. [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
319. the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
320. director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
321. a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
322. family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
323. for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .
324. enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
325. this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .
326. when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
327. represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre .
328. as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
329. initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
330. de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .
331. dismally dull sci-fi comedy .
332. the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
333. a singularly off-putting romantic comedy .
334. a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story .
335. the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .
336. [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
337. once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
338. a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .
339. the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
340. there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
341. the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic .
342. the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
343. an intriguing near-miss .
344. all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
345. a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
346. a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
347. what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits .
348. visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
349. allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
350. the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
351. despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
352. flat , misguided comedy .
353. the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
354. though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious .
355. though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
356. it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
357. in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
358. a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
359. an ugly , revolting movie .
360. a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .
361. the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
362. an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
363. supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
364. the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
365. this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
366. the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
367. the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
368. while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
369. a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
370. the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
371. a well-acted , but one-note film .
372. ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay .
373. some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .
374. the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
375. an extraordinarily silly thriller .
376. the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
377. the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
378. a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
379. a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
380. rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .
381. some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
382. an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
383. the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
384. an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
385. further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
386. any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors .
387. the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .
388. in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
389. the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
390. though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
391. a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
392. as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction .
393. the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
394. a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film .
395. though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .
396. singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs  a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story  but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .
397. a taut , intelligent psychological drama .
398. at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
399. an imaginative comedy/thriller .
400. director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth .
401. writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear .
402. the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
403. a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
404. edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery .
405. a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .
406. between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results .
407. [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists .
408. the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
409. it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
410. like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
411. waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality .
412. tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .
413. there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
414. a very funny movie .
415. a fascinating and fun film .
416. a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy .
417. australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation .
418. without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions .
419. though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .
420. elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .
421. provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz .
422. this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
423. the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
424. it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes .
425. parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
426. a wonderful character-based comedy .
427. an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
428. it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
429. the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
430. this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
431. attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
432. the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
433. the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
434. boisterous , heartfelt comedy .
435. though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .
436. a slick , skillful little horror film .
437. a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth .
438. its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
439. this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format .
440. lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie .
441. disturbing and brilliant documentary .
442. [villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death .
443. what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved .
444. the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
445. the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
446. this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .

966. this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .

1. 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
2. the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
3. writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
4. in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
5. 'the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
6. a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
7. wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
8. 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
9. 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
10. were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
11. a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
12. who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
13. for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
14. sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '

16. anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
17. in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
18. a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
19. a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
20. despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
21. adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
22. a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
23. this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '

33. often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american 'hosts' and their 'guests . '

39. it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
40. beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
41. definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
42. 'stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . '
43. 'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . '
44. ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 'cultural revolution . '
45. 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
46. almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '

48. ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '

50. 'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
51. 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
52. ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
53. 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
54. unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
55. 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
56. nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
57. this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
58. 'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
59. a fun family movie that's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , 'it's never too late to believe in your dreams . '

61. 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
============= Cluster 10: =============
0. the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
1. the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
2. the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
============= Cluster 5: =============
0. the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . "
1. the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . "
2. amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . "
3. " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . "
4. in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . "
5. it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . "
6. opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . "
7. . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . "
8. never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . "
9. the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . "
10. tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . "
11. the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . "
12. while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . "
13. in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . "
14. if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . "
15. the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . "
16. droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . "
17. funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . "
18. too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . "
19. this is not a retread of " dead poets' society . "
20. dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . "
21. " . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . "

1. how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .
