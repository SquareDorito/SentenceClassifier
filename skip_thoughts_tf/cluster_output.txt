============= Cluster 2: =============
0. a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
1. an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
2. a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
3. directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
4. rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
5. a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .
6. as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
7. an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
8. [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
9. a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .
10. its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
11. with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
12. some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
13. this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
14. directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .
15. the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .
16. the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
17. the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .
18. an extremely unpleasant film .
19. a high-minded snoozer .
20. labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
21. the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
22. a film that loses sight of its own story .
23. few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance .
24. the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
25. a generic international version of a typical american horror film .
26. lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
27. shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
28. although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
29. [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
30. there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
31. in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
32. a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
33. the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack .
34. a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
35. an ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
36. what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
37. as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .
38. it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
39. a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
40. ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism .
41. the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
42. the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
43. a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
44. jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
45. the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
46. each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
47. the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects Â— from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .
48. the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
49. the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
50. it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
51. the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
52. the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
53. chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
54. . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
55. schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression .
56. the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
57. the characters are based on stock clichÃ©s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
58. a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
59. a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .
60. will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
61. the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
62. an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
63. the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
64. a fascinating but choppy documentary .
65. plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
66. the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
67. the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
68. a film that suffers because of its many excesses .
69. a dreary movie .
70. boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .
71. a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
72. the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
73. the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
74. the whole film has this sneaky feel to it Â– as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
75. there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
76. it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
77. brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
78. its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
79. the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
80. it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
81. . . . a bland , pretentious mess .
82. this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
83. super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers .
84. egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
85. [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
86. when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
87. kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .
88. director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .
89. while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
90. a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
91. the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
92. the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .
93. the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys .
94. a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
95. at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
96. the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
97. a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
98. overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
99. despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
100. this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
101. the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
102. while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
103. while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
104. a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
105. simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
106. the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
107. pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .
108. at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
109. a coarse and stupid gross-out .
110. a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
111. the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
112. but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .
113. star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .
114. its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
115. characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs .
116. in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buÃ±uel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
117. it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
118. while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
119. an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
120. a sometimes tedious film .
121. for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
122. the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
123. the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .
124. though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
125. on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
126. historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
127. perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
128. this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
129. even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
130. the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
131. marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
132. the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
133. the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
134. obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
135. a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
136. the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
137. a bit of an unwieldy mess .
138. the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
139. there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
140. much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
141. each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
142. as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
143. the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
144. the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
145. kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .
146. a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
147. being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
148. offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
149. feeble comedy .
150. with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
151. a dreadful live-action movie .
152. spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
153. [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
154. it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
155. the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
156. there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .
157. a less-than-thrilling thriller .
158. everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
159. with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
160. as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
161. though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
162. it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
163. what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form .
164. the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
165. newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept Â– a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
166. an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma .
167. the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
168. an awkward and indigestible movie .
169. the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
170. the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
171. sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
172. a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
173. it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
174. a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
175. stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition Â– wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text Â– when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
176. the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
177. the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
178. as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
179. preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
180. as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
181. the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .
182. a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
183. a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller .
184. based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
185. this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .
186. overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim .
187. herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .
188. creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
189. as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
190. bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
191. reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
192. despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
193. all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
194. an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
195. strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery .
196. the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
197. an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
198. succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .
199. christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic .
200. while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
201. gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .
202. the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
203. the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected .
204. a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
205. the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
206. the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
207. the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
208. it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious .
209. sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
210. a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
211. roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
212. twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .
213. while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
214. the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
215. the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
216. here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
217. it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .
218. a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
219. to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
220. although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless Â‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
221. a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .
222. this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
223. though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
224. a negligible british comedy .
225. a pretentious mess .
226. because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
227. contrived pastiche of caper clichÃ©s .
228. despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
229. there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
230. the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design .
231. a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .
232. a collage of clichÃ©s and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
233. the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
234. lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
235. not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest .
236. its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
237. an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
238. a half-assed film .
239. while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
240. interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .
241. cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
242. it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
243. even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .
244. though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
245. the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
246. the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .
247. at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
248. the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
249. there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .
250. a preposterous , prurient whodunit .
251. the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
252. an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
253. it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
254. the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
255. the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
256. much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clichÃ© .
257. the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
258. opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
259. the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
260. unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
261. an uninspired preachy and clichÃ©d war film .
262. slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
263. the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
264. the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
265. nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
266. there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
267. like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
268. brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
269. a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
270. viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .
271. writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
272. unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
273. the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
274. a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
275. it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .
276. nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
277. aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
278. with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
279. an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
280. the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
281. a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
282. swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
283. almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences .
284. tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
285. a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
286. whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
287. high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .
288. the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .
289. a lame comedy .
290. deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
291. a dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
292. an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
293. high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
294. screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
295. a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
296. full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
297. a reality-snubbing hodgepodge .
298. the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
299. although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
300. after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichÃ©s , depression and bad alternative music .
301. a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
302. coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .
303. mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
304. a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
305. an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
306. the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
307. each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
308. holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
309. an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
310. the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
311. what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
312. while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation .
313. a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
314. dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
315. time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
316. as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
317. the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
318. [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
319. the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
320. director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
321. a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
322. family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
323. for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .
324. enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
325. this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .
326. when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
327. represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre .
328. as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
329. initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
330. de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .
331. dismally dull sci-fi comedy .
332. the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
333. a singularly off-putting romantic comedy .
334. a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story .
335. the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .
336. [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
337. once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
338. a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .
339. the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
340. there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
341. the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic .
342. the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
343. an intriguing near-miss .
344. all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
345. a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
346. a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
347. what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits .
348. visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
349. allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
350. the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
351. despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
352. flat , misguided comedy .
353. the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
354. though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious .
355. though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
356. it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
357. in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
358. a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
359. an ugly , revolting movie .
360. a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .
361. the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
362. an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
363. supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
364. the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
365. this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
366. the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
367. the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
368. while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
369. a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
370. the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
371. a well-acted , but one-note film .
372. ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay .
373. some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .
374. the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
375. an extraordinarily silly thriller .
376. the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
377. the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
378. a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
379. a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
380. rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naÃ¯f's encounter with the world .
381. some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
382. an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
383. the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
384. an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
385. further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
386. any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors .
387. the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .
388. in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
389. the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
390. though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
391. a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
392. as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction .
393. the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
394. a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film .
395. though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .
396. singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs Â— a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story Â— but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .
397. a taut , intelligent psychological drama .
398. at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
399. an imaginative comedy/thriller .
400. director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth .
401. writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear .
402. the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
403. a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
404. edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery .
405. a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .
406. between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results .
407. [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists .
408. the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
409. it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
410. like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
411. waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality .
412. tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .
413. there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
414. a very funny movie .
415. a fascinating and fun film .
416. a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy .
417. australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation .
418. without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions .
419. though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .
420. elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .
421. provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz .
422. this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
423. the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
424. it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes .
425. parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
426. a wonderful character-based comedy .
427. an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
428. it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
429. the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
430. this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
431. attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
432. the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
433. the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
434. boisterous , heartfelt comedy .
435. though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .
436. a slick , skillful little horror film .
437. a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth .
438. its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
439. this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format .
440. lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie .
441. disturbing and brilliant documentary .
442. [villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death .
443. what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved .
444. the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
445. the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
446. this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .

929. although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching .

964. the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill .
965. the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting .
966. this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .
967. devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking .

988. represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema .

997. a melancholy , emotional film .
998. the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .

1000. the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .

1016. as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson .
1017. if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .

1019. the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .

1. 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
2. the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
3. writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '

5. 'the chÃ¢teau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
6. a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
7. wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
8. 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
9. 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
10. were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
11. a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
12. who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '

16. anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
17. in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
18. a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
19. a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
20. despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
21. adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
22. a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
23. this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '

28. 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '

39. it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
40. beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '

48. ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '

51. 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
52. ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
53. 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
54. unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
55. 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
56. nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '

============= Cluster 10: =============
0. the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
1. the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
2. the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
============= Cluster 5: =============
0. the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . "
1. the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . "
2. amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . "
3. " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . "
4. in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rÃ©sumÃ© loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . "
5. it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . "
6. opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . "
7. . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . "
8. never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . "
9. the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . "
10. tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . "
11. the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . "
12. while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . "
13. in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . "
14. if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . "
15. the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . "
16. droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . "
17. funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . "
18. too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . "
19. this is not a retread of " dead poets' society . "
20. dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . "
21. " . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . "
